/**
 * This class contains static methods which convert between Java CompletionStage
 * and Scala Future. This is useful when mediating between Scala and Java
 * libraries with asynchronous APIs.
 *
 * Note that the bridge is implemented at the read-only side of asynchronous
 * handles, namely scala.concurrent.Future instead of scala.concurrent.Promise
 * and CompletionStage instead of CompletableFuture. This is intentional, as
 * the semantics of bridging the write-handles would be prone to race
 * conditions; if both ends (CompletableFuture and Promise) are completed
 * independently at the same time, they may contain different values afterwards.
 * For this reason, <code>toCompletableFuture()</code> is not supported on the
 * created CompletionStages.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * {{{
 * import java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage;
 * import scala.concurrent.Future;
 * import static scala.concurrent.java8.FutureConverter.*;
 *
 * final CompletionStage<String> cs = ... // from an async Java API
 * final Future<String> f = toScala(cs);
 * ...
 * final Future<Integer> f2 = ... // from an async Scala API
 * final CompletionStage<Integer> cs2 = toJava(f2);
 * }}}
