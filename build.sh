# Builds of tagged revisions are published to sonatype staging.

# Travis runs a build on new revisions and on new tags, so a tagged revision is built twice.
# Builds for a tag have TRAVIS_TAG defined, which we use for identifying tagged builds.

# sbt-dynver sets the version number from the tag
# sbt-travisci sets the Scala version from the travis job matrix

# To back-publish an existing release for a new Scala / Scala.js / Scala Native version:
# - check out the tag for the version that needs to be published
# - change `.travis.yml` to adjust the version numbers and trim down the build matrix as necessary
# - commit the changes and tag this new revision with an arbitrary suffix after a hash, e.g.,
#   `v1.2.3#dotty-0.27` (the suffix is ignored, the version will be `1.2.3`)

# We release on JDK 8 (for Scala 2.x and Dotty 0.x)
